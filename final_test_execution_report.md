- ✅ OpenAI Whisper with PyTorch
- ✅ Quality tools: bandit, safety, flake8, black, isort, mypy
- ✅ Test utilities: factory-boy, faker

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install any remaining dependencies (if needed)
make install-dev

# 2. Run complete test suite
make test

# 3. Generate coverage report
make coverage

# 4. Run specific test categories
make test-unit

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Import Errors
If you see module import errors:
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
make install
```

#### 2. Missing System Dependencies
If you see libmagic or ffmpeg errors:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libmagic1 ffmpeg
```

#### 3. Permission Issues
If pip installation fails:
```bash
# The Makefile now includes --break-system-packages
make install-dev
```

#### 4. Whisper Model Download
On first test run, Whisper will download models:
```bash
# This is normal and happens once
# Models are cached for subsequent runs
```

### Test Environment Variables
The tests use these optimized settings:
```bash
DB_PATH=:memory:          # Fast in-memory database
WHISPER_MODEL=tiny        # Fast model for testing
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
